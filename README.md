SmartThings App - http://www.smartthings.com

Turn on your porch light, dimmed, at sunset and increase to full brightness when someone arrives. After a number of minutes, dim the light back to its original level. Optionally, set the light to turn off at a specified time while still turning on when someone arrives. This app runs from sunset to sunrise.
